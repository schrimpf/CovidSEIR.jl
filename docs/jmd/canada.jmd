```julia
using CovidSEIR, CovidData,  Plots, DataFrames, JLD2, StatsPlots, MCMCChains
Plots.pyplot()
jmddir = normpath(joinpath(dirname(Base.find_package("CovidSEIR")),"..","docs","jmd"))
covdf = covidjhudata();
```

# Canada

We estimate the model with the following code. It takes about an hour.

```julia
canada = CountryData(covdf, "Canada");
```

```julia; eval=false
using Turing
canmod = CovidSEIR.TimeVarying.countrymodel(canada)
cc = Turing.psample(canmod, NUTS(0.65), 5000, 4)
import JLD2
JLD2.@save "$jmddir/canada_$(Dates.today()).jld2" cc
```

```julia
JLD2.@load "$jmddir/canada_dhmc_2020-04-13.jld2" cc dayt0;
cc = MCMCChains.Chains(collect(cc.value.data), replace.(cc.name_map.parameters, r"([^\[])([1-9])" => s"\1[\2]"))
```

## Estimates

```julia
plot(cc)
```

We can see that there might be convergence issues. There are large
differences between the four chains for some parameters.

```julia
describe(cc)
```

The parameter estimates are generally not very precise.


## Fit

```julia
sdf = simtrajectories(cc, canada, 1:200)
f = plotvars(sdf, canada)
f.fit
```

In this figure, solid lines are observed data, dashed lines are
posterior means, and the shaded region is a pointwise 90\% credible
interval.


## Implications

We now look at the model's projections for some observed and unobserved variables.

```julia
for fig in f.trajectories
  display(fig)
end
```

In general we see a similar pattern as noted above: the posteriors for
observed variables are fairly precise. However, the posteriors for
unobserved variables, such as the portion of undetected infections and
the portion of mild infections, are very imprecise.
